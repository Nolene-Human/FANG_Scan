This section outlines the applied ‘test early and test often’ methodology to enhance the security of the application and mitigate the risk of attacks. Following the 4 out of 7 the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model proposed by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) , which consists of seven phases: definition, design, development, testing, deployment, maintenance, and retirement. In each phase, this project performed various security activities, such as threat modeling, automated testing (using Snyk), code review, and pentesting techniques, to identify and address any vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the application.
